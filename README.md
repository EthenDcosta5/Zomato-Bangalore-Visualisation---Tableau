# Bengaluru Restaurant Analysis - Zomato Dataset

## Project Overview

This project leverages a dataset of restaurants in Bengaluru, sourced from Zomato, to analyze various aspects of restaurant performance. The goal is to provide insights into customer preferences, service availability, and restaurant characteristics using **Tableau** for visualization.

## Key Objectives

1. **Availability of Online Ordering**: 
   - Analyze how many restaurants offer online ordering and how this varies by location.
  
2. **Table Booking Options**: 
   - Explore the relationship between table booking availability, restaurant ratings, and popularity.

3. **Restaurant Ratings**: 
   - Visualize the distribution of restaurant ratings across the city and identify neighborhoods with the highest-rated restaurants.

4. **Customer Engagement**: 
   - Investigate the correlation between the number of votes (customer reviews) and overall restaurant ratings.

5. **Cuisine Types**: 
   - Discover the most popular cuisines across Bengaluru and how they vary by neighborhood.

6. **Cost Analysis**: 
   - Analyze the average cost for two people at restaurants by location and examine the relationship between cost, ratings, and popularity.

7. **Neighborhood Analysis**: 
   - Identify areas with the highest concentration of restaurants and highly-rated establishments.

8. **Restaurant Types**: 
   - Compare different restaurant types (Quick Bites, Casual Dining, etc.) in terms of ratings and costs.

9. **Dishes Liked**: 
   - Analyze customer preferences for dishes across different restaurant types and cuisine trends.

10. **Meal Types Offered**: 
    - Identify common meal types (e.g., Buffet, Delivery) in highly-rated restaurants.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information such as:
- Restaurant names
- Locations (neighborhoods)
- Ratings
- Cost for two people
- Votes (customer reviews)
- Availability of online ordering and table booking
- Cuisine types
- Meal types offered
- Popular dishes

## Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel/CSV**: Data cleaning and preparation.

## Key Insights

- Restaurants offering online ordering and table booking are more common in certain high-density neighborhoods.
- Higher-rated restaurants tend to receive more customer reviews and are concentrated in upscale areas like Koramangala and Indiranagar.
- Popular cuisines like North Indian and South Indian dominate the food scene, with international cuisines being prevalent in select areas.

## Visualizations

The Tableau dashboard includes the following visualizations:
1. Bar charts showing online ordering and table booking availability by location.
2. Heatmaps and pie charts for the distribution of restaurant ratings and popular meal types.
3. Scatter plots for analyzing the correlation between customer reviews and ratings.
4. Neighborhood-based maps highlighting restaurant concentration and performance.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EthenDcosta5/bengaluru-restaurant-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Tableau workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx` file) to explore the visualizations.

## Future Improvements

- Include more detailed customer sentiment analysis based on review content.
- Explore time-based trends to see how restaurant ratings or services change over time.
- Expand analysis to include more cities or compare Bengaluru with other urban centers.
